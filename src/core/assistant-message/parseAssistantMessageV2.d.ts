/**
 * Parses an assistant message string potentially containing mixed text and tool
 * usage blocks marked with XML-like tags into an array of structured content
 * objects.
 *
 * This version aims for efficiency by avoiding the character-by-character
 * accumulator of V1. It iterates through the string using an index `i`. At each
 * position, it checks if the substring *ending* at `i` matches any known
 * opening or closing tags for tools or parameters using `startsWith` with an
 * offset.
 * It uses pre-computed Maps (`toolUseOpenTags`, `toolParamOpenTags`) for quick
 * tag lookups.
 * State is managed using indices (`currentTextContentStart`,
 * `currentToolUseStart`, `currentParamValueStart`) pointing to the start of the
 * current block within the original `assistantMessage` string.
 *
 * Slicing is used to extract content only when a block (text, parameter, or
 * tool use) is completed.
 *
 * Special handling for `write_to_file` and `new_rule` content parameters is
 * included, using `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` on the relevant slice to handle
 * potentially nested closing tags.
 *
 * If the input string ends mid-block, the last open block is added and marked
 * as partial.
 *
 * @param assistantMessage The raw string output from the assistant.
 * @returns An array of `AssistantMessageContent` objects, which can be
 *          `TextContent` or `ToolUse`. Blocks that were not fully closed by the
 *          end of the input string will have their `partial` flag set to
 *          `true`.
