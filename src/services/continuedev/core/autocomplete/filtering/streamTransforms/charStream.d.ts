 * 1. If no stop tokens are provided, yields all characters from the stream.
 * 2. Otherwise, buffers incoming chunks and checks for stop tokens.
 * 3. Yields characters one by one if no stop token is found at the start of the buffer.
 * 4. Stops yielding and returns if a stop token is encountered.
 * 5. After the stream ends, filters encountered stop tokens in remaining buffer.
 * 6. Yields any remaining buffered characters.
