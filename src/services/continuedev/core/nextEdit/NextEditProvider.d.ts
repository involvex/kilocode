/**
 * This is the next edit analogue to autocomplete's CompletionProvider.
 * You will see a lot of similar if not identical methods to CompletionProvider methods.
 * All logic used to live inside this class, but that became untenable quickly.
 * I moved a lot of the model-specific logic (prompt building, pre/post processing, etc.) to the BaseNextEditProvider and the children inheriting from it.
 * Keeping this class around might be a good idea because it handles lots of delicate logic such as abort signals, chains, logging, etc.
 * There being a singleton also gives a lot of guarantees about the state of the next edit state machine.
